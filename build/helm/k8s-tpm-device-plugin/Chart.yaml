description: The Helm chart for a Kubernetes TPM device plugin

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
appVersion: "1.16.0"

# The device manager is only GA and default since Kubernetes 1.26
# NOTE: the notation below includes "pre-release" versions. This is done for multiple reasons:
# - some Kubernetes vendored versions are not using "proper" SemVer 2, and are using
#   pre-release version strings instead of build-version strings
# - any pre-release version will have the support already anyways, so it is a safe notation
# For details see: https://github.com/Masterminds/semver#working-with-prerelease-versions
