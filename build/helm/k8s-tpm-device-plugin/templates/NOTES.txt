The purpose of this device plugin is that you can request access to the TPM
device of the host without the need for privileged access of pods.

You can request a TPM device by requesting it through pod limits of 1 like the
following: `githedgehog.com/tpmrm: 1`.
This makes the /dev/tpmrm0 device available inside of a pod.

Here is an example Fedora pod in YAML definition which requests a TPM device
through this plugin:

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: tpm-device-test
spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 1
  containers:
  - name: tpm-device-test
    image: fedora:latest
    command:
    - /bin/bash
    - -c
    - while true; do sleep 3600; done
    resources:
      limits:
        githedgehog.com/tpmrm: 1
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      capabilities:
        drop: ["ALL"]
```

Once you shell into this pod, you can run the following commands to test
access to the TPM:

```
kubectl exec -ti tpm-device-test -- /bin/bash

dnf install -y --no-install-recommends tpm2-tools
tpm2_getcap --list
tpm2_getrandom --hex 16
```
